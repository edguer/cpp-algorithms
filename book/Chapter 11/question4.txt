This seems like an external merge sort problem: we can break down the file in smaller chunks that fit in memory, order them and save as separated files. We then open as many files as we can by reading them per smaller chunks or per line, and compare each string we get from each one. The smaller string will be copied to the final results file every time. Example: line1 of file 1 is greater than lin1 of file2? If yes, then write line1 to the results file and go to the next line on file1. Now is line2 on file1 greater than line1 of file2? And so on...
